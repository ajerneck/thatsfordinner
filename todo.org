* Improve raw data.
- find a good recipe api (yummly?) and use that.

* Improve feature engineering
- use tf-idf to find important words: then, filter the word count matrix using
  the tf-idf matrix, and feed that to lda.
- use bigrams / unigrams, but cut out those in fewer than ~3 documents.
- max_df should probably not be used, because it cannot distinguish between
  common across docs and common in groups of docs.
